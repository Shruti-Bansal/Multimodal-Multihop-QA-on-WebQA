Multimodal Machine Learning Project for Fall'23


To generate the embeddings from the pretrained UniVL-DR
- go to the folder ```Univl-DR``` 
- create an environment (conda env with ```python==3.8``` should be enough) with the file ```requirements.txt```
- download the necessary files and put them in the right folders. You can modify these paths in the default args of the scripts. 

For an example, going to ```UniVL-DR/UniVL-DR``` and run ```python custom_embeddings_demo.py``` would load the pretrained model and embed 5 queries and the associated sources. 
This serves as an example, and you can see which files you need to have and folders you need to update.
